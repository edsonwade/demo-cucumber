# demo-cucumber

## Introduction
This repository contains a demonstration of testing using Behavior-Driven Development
(BDD) with Cucumber for a Java Spring Boot application.
It includes tests covering various aspects such as REST API endpoints using `MockMvc`,
`ResponseEntity`, and integration tests for controllers, services, and repositories.

## Content Description
The tests are structured to ensure comprehensive coverage of different layers of the application:

- **Controller Tests**: Validate the behavior of REST endpoints using `MockMvc` for simulating HTTP requests and verifying responses.
- **Service Tests**: Test the business logic and interactions within service layers.
- **Repository Tests**: Verify the interactions with the database layer using Spring's test framework.
- **BDD Tests with Cucumber**: Define and execute scenarios in a human-readable format using Gherkin syntax, enhancing collaboration between stakeholders and developers.

## Implementation
### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- Maven
- Spring Boot

### Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
mvn test

git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

git commit -am 'Add some feature'

git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```
